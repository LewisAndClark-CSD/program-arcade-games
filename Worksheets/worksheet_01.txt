     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
print('Adam')
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
# hi there
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3)  0.6
     print(2 // 3) 2/3
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
from math import pi
pi = pi
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     one of the variables is not capitalized
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a  
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle <--- this one
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple   x
     Apple   x
     APPLE   x
     Apple2   x
     1Apple   x
     account number  x
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber   x
     account#   x
     pi   x
     PI
     fred   x
     Fred   x
     GreatBigVariable   x
     greatBigVariable   x
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable   x
     2x   x
     x2x
     total%   x
     #left   x
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     the variable needs to be before the print statement
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     the integer isnt long enough
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     no one knows what x means
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     its a str, not an int statement
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     a isnt defined
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     float needs to be before input
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)  <--- this one
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
 15. What is a constant?
something that stays the same.
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
they dont change
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
(/" /") (/' /')
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
yes
 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
bc python uses order of operations
 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
its a math symbol
 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)    it prints out 3
     
 23. Correct the following code:
     
     username = input("Enter your name: )"
     

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input("Enter your age"))
