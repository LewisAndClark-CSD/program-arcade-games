     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
  print('Brady Ballmann')

  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?

  Using a #
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     1. Prints .6 repeating
     2. Prints 0
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
pi = 3.14
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     Because the A variable is captial and the print a is not
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle 
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
     area_of_rectangle is the best one because it uses _ to replace spaces and lower case letters
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple 
     APPLE  
     Apple2 
     1Apple 
     account number <--- This one
     account_number 
     account.number <--- This one
     accountNumber
     account# <--- This one
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable <--- This one
     2x
     x2x
     total% <--- This one
     #left <--- This one
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     because the print statement comes before the variable
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
     It doesnt need to float
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     You could just set pi to 3.14 instead of making x = 3.14 
     
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     The 3rd line does not need to be seperated by Quotations. 
     
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     They are not integers
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     You need an int
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     They all print the same thing but the 1st one is better to use because it is smaller and keeps the code looking nice :D.
     
 15. What is a constant?

 A variable that doesnt change. 
 
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
 
 You can normally tell when a variable is a constant because they will be in CAPS

 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     
     "" ''

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
     
     print('This \r\nis')

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
     
     Yes

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
     Because that is not what you are asking it to do
     

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
 
 Symbols that carry out logical computation. 
 
 

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
     3

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
     
     

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input("Enter your age"))
     
     print('Your age is', value)
