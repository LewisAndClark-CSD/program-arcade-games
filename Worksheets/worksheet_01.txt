     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
  
  print('Cole Rob')

  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
  
  #example comment

  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     
     the first one divides 2 by 3 and the second one does the same but rounds the number
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.

     	pi = 3.14159
     	
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     Because the a you're trying to print is lowercase and the one you set is uppercase
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
        
        area_of_rectangle because it is clear what it is and you will easily be able to identify it
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     
      account#, great.big.variable, total%, #left 
      
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     you have to set the variable BEFORE you try and print it otherwise the variable wont exisist until after its printed
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
     it needs to be == not = 
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     You can set the value for pi from the start
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     The program runs fine but the variable names could be better
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     It won't call the 'int'
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     The float doesn't have to come in right away
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     The top one is most compact and easily understood 
     
 15. What is a constant?

    A variable that never changes
    
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
    
    Should be mixed case with capitals initiating each word.
    
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
        
        single quote, ex: 'Cole'
        double quote, ex: "Cole"
        Both do the same 
        
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

     
     
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?

        Yes it can
        
 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
    Order of operations will make this divide first, you need more parenthesis to make it work
    
 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?

    Symbols in python that carry out a problem. Ex: + or - adds or subtracts
    
 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
     this is only gonna print 3 because x is established as 3 if you wanted x to add 3 + 1 you have to do x = x + 1
     

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
        
        user_name = input('Enter your name: ')
        
        
 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     

    value = int(input('Enter your age: '))
    print(value)
