     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
print("Asia Robinson")
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
#comment
  3. What do the following lines of code output? the answer to 2/3
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer? 
     
     print(2 / 3)0.66
     print(2 // 3)
     0
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
pi = 3.14
  5. Why does this code not work?THe capitalization is wrong
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use? area_of_rectangle
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     total% and #left arent allowed
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     
  8. Why does this code not work? The computer doesn't have anything to define. 
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code: The mistake is that it's already an float.
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     The only thing is wrong is that you made an extra varibale(x).
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     The mistake is the extra two parenthesis 
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     The mistake says that 'int' object is not callable
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
 The mistake is that it could not convert string to float: 'Enter the radius:'
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     yes they all print the same value. print(2 / 3 + 4) is better to use because it's easier for the programmer to see.
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
 15. What is a constant?
A constant is values that can't be altrered by the program.

 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
 Unlike any other variable names constant variable names are immutable.

 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
(Double Quote):"Asia"
(Single Quote):'Asia'     

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
print("I love pizza \"\n with a side of nachos.")
     
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead of double quotes? Yes

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
   It's too generic. There's not enough code for the computer to interpret what your trying to make it do.   
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
 An operator is special symbols that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. 

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
 SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement
    

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     value = int(input("Enter your age"))
