     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
  
  print("Ryan Moore")

  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
  
  with a #

  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3) .06666666
     print(2 // 3) 0
     
     It rounds to the lowest closted number 
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
     	
     	

  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     The a is not caplitalized 
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle- This one
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number- This one
     accountNumber
     account#- This one
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left- This one
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     The print is before the variable 
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     float is the opposite of int
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     remove x and put pi=3.14
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
    
    you dont need the parentheses around the x and y
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
    the three is out of the parentheses
    
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  ) 
     
     Yes they all print the same thing and the first one is the better one it takes less time to read it 
     
 15. What is a constant?

 a variable that doesn't change 
 
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?

 A constant will be in all caps 
 
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     
\'-single 
\"-double 

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

     
     
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes? Yes

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3) because it does division first
      

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
 
symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
     prints 3

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
     

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input("Enter your age"))
     print (value)
