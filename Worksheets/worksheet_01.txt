     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
  
  print("Justin Riebow")

  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
  
  Using #

  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3) .66 
     print(2 // 3) 0
     
     the first one gives the decimal and the second one tells you how many times 3 goes into 2
     
     
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.

     	from math import pi
     	pi = pi
     	
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     the variable is a capital A and it is trying to print the value of the variable "a" (Capitalization matters)
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
    
    area_of_rectangle <- This is the better variable name because it is the most descriptive and doesn't using capitalization
    
    Area_Of_Rectangle
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple - not allowed
     account number
     account_number
     account.number - not allowed
     accountNumber
     account# - not allowed
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable - not allowed
     2x - not allowed
     x2x
     total% - not allowed
     #left - not allowed
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     it's trying to print the variable before it is read so it technically doesn't exist
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
     you cannot float a decimal because float turns it into a decimal
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     Instead of doing "x = 3.14" and "pi = x" it could just say "pi = 3.14"
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     the x and y do not need parentheses around them individually
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     the 3 will not multiply with the x and y without using *
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     It should be int(input("Enter the radius:"))
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     they all come out the same but the better one to use is the one without spaces
     
 15. What is a constant?
 
 a value that stays the same

 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
 
 they are usual one word and less descriptive

 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     
     Single quote = 'this is a single quote'  Double quote = "this is a double quote"

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
     
     print("\"\n")

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
     
     Yes

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
     it first divides 5 by three then adds it all together. It needs to put the addition in parentheses so it does that first
     

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
 
 operators modify numbers

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
it will print 3
 
 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
     

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     
value = int(input("Enter your age"))
age = print(value)
