     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
        print("Jared Rhodes")
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
        You use the # character to create a comment that won't be read by the program
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3) prints the sum of 2 divided by 3 
     print(2 // 3) prints 2 / 3 
     
     These do different things because a single / is used as a math operator so in order to print a / out you need to use an escape code
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
     	
     	pi = 3.1415926

  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     This code won't work because capitalization matters and A and a are seen as 2 different variables
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle - According to standards for python the one to the left is the best way of naming variabels
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple - not allowed
     account number - not allowed
     account_number
     account.number - not allowed
     accountNumber
     account# - not allowed
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable - not allowed
     2x - not allowed
     x2x
     total% - not allowed
     #left - not allowed
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     You are assigning a variable a value after you print it so the a being 45 is unknown
     by the computer untill after it tried to print a causeing an error
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
     3.14 is already a float to the computer since it has decimals points which integers can't have so declaring it as a float is redundent
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     There is no reason to have an x variable that only passes a value onto another variable, so pi = 3.14 is better and saves time/space/annoyance
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     The parentheses in the a = statment are useless because order of opperations is unimportant for a single operation
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     As humans we can understand that means to distribute but a computer needs to be explicitly told that by doing 3 * (x + y)
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     Your supposed to put the float in front of the input statment so the input statment can return the correct variable type
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     All of them will be understood by the computer, however normal python standards make the second print statment the correct one
     
 15. What is a constant?
 
    A variable that remains unchanged throughtout the program such as PI = 3.1415926

 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
 
    Constant variable names are capililized such as TEST_CONSTANT

 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     
     ' - This is a single quote
     " - This is a double quote

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
     
     print("\"\r\n")

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
     
     Yes it can, print('Hello World') works just as print("Hello World") does

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
     Because of the order of operations the 5 / 3 would happen first and then the others would be added
     print((3 + 4 + 5) / 3) would be the correct way of doign it

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
 
    It is a character that stands for a math function such as addition subtraction division ect...

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
     This program prints out
     
     3
     
 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
     

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input("Enter your age"))
