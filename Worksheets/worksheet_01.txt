     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
	print(James Allen)
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
	You have to use the pound sign.
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     They divide 2 by 3 the difference between them is the one with // will round the answer
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
	pi = 3.14
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     The a isn't capitalized so it isn't a defined variable
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     Area_Of_Rectangle is the best name to use
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
A aA      area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     account.number, account#, and #left
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     a is defined after the print statement
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     ou can't float a decimal point
     pi = float(3.14)
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     They could get rid of x and pi and just multiply it by 3.14
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     it will raise 4 to the fifth power
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     it is going to multiply the sum of x and y by 3
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     You have to do the input inside the float
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     they all print the same value, (2 / 3 + 4) is the better one to use becaue there is space so you can see the separate values
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
 15. What is a constant?
	A variable that always stays the same
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
	constant variable names are immutable
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
    'Hello'
    "Hello"
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
    print("I wnat to print a double quote\"\n for some reason.")
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
    Yes, print("I want to print a double quote \'\n for some reason")
 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     It does in this specific situation with these numbers
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
Special symbols that carry out arithmetic or logical computations
 22. What does the following program print out?
     SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
    
    value = int(input('Enter your age'))
     print(value)
