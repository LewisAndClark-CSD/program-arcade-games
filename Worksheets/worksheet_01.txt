     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.

  print('Sean Kang')
  
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?

  Use # or ''' or """
  
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     The first one divides 2 from 3 the second one divides 3 from 
     2. They give different outputs because thats how division 
     works
    
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets it to an appropriate value.

  pi = 3.14
  
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     Because its printing a lowercase a when the variable is an upper case A
 
 6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
     area_of_rectangle is the best one to use because its short and simple but it also tells you what it is used for
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
    #left
    
    account number
    account.number
    account#
    great.big.variable
    total%
    #left  
    
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     You cant print something when the variable is below it.
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
     
     The float is not needed
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     Does not need the pi = x
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     You only need one set of perentheses is line 3
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     you need a * to symbolize multiplication otherwise the code will fail
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     The float should go in front of the input
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     Yes they all print the same value, it would be best to use the second one because theyre not to close together or to far apart
     
 15. What is a constant?

 Something in the code that stays the same throughout the program
 
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?

 Variable names can change
 
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.

     a single quote is '' and double quote is "". These are used for comments and printing.
     
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

     
     
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?

     yes 
     
 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     because it does not follow order of operations
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?

any sign that is used for math equations 
 
 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     3 + 1 which would be 4
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     
     The second quotation should be in the perentheses

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     
you dont need the int since you are typing in a name and not a number
