     Chapter 01 Worksheet

     
     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
name = input('What is your name? ')
print(name)
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
# This is a comment!
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     2 / 3 and 2 // 3
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     They give put two different answers because 2 / 3 is dividing and 2 // 3 is only giving the rounded down amount.
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
pi = 3.14
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
This code does not work because the 'A' variable is different from the variable used in the print statement. It should be, print(A).
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
The best variable to use would be area_of_rectangle, because it is descriptive of what the variable is describing.
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     1Apple
     account number
     acount.number
     account#
The variables are 1Apple, account number, account.number, account#. great.big.variable, account_number.
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
The variable needs to be before the print statement.
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
It outputs the code 3.14 if it was being printed, but it was placed into a string not a print statement so the computer doesn't read it as a string.
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
multiple statements found while compiling a single statement. 
radius = input("Radius:")
    radius = float(radius)
    x = 3.14
    pi = x
    area = pi * radius ** 2
    
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
multiple statements found while compiling a single statement.
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
Syntax error multiple statements.      
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
Yes all of them are the same print value. The first one because it is the most simple.      
 15. What is a constant?
A constant is when you set something too one thing like a value of a variable. 
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
The variable name can be changed in the code later on but the cosntants have a given value and thus can't be changed.
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
'Hi.' single quote. "Hello." double quote.
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
print("I want to print a double quote \" for some reason.")
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
Yes a python program can print text to the screen using single quotes instead of double quotes.
 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
This code doesn't calculate the average because the code doesn't read the order of operations.     

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
It stores a value into variable to used later on in the code.
 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
It prints out 3.     

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
It should look like this, 
user_name("Enter your name: ")
print(user_name)

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
value = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(value)
