     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
print("Lauren")

  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
enter comments using '#'
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3) division =0.6
     print(2 // 3) floor division rounds the answer down to the nearest integer. =0
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
pi = 3.141596

  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
it doesnt work because they arent integers. You can use int() to fix this.
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
 Area_Of_Rectangle is the best name.
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number not allowed
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account# not allowed
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable 
     2x
     x2x
     total% not allowed
     #left not allowed
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
because a isn't specified as an integer.
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
it should look like this: pi= int(float(3.14))
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     
     print(area)
     
should be pi = area
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
should change a to area
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
python cannot do multiplication this way

 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
    
Yes they all print the same value. print(2 / 3 + 4) is probably the best to use because it is the easiest to read and best organized.
     
 15. What is a constant?
 
 true, false, or none.

 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?

 they aren't just a word that the user can set, they have a meaning and will trigger an effect.
 
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     
'- single 
"- double

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
     
print('\"', \n)

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
     
Yes, it does not matter which one you use.

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
Because python does not understand order or operations that way.
     

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
 
a word that performs an operatiom

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
the program prints out 3.
     

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     
it should be user_name = input("Enter your name: )
     

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
correct: value = int(input("Enter your age"))
