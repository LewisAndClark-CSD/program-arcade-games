     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.

        print("RyanRosvall")
  
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?

        use the # and type behind it. 
        EX: #Ryan
  
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     
        the first one divides 2 by 3 and the 2nd one does the same thing but rounds the number.
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.

     	pi = 3.14
     	
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     The variables arent the same.
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
    
        area_of_rectangle is because its descriptive and you'll know what it is when you see it in the code.
    
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     
        account#, great.big.variable, total%, #left 
        
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
        You need to set what the variable is = to before you print it.
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
        it needs to be == instead of =
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
        You can just make pi = 3.14 from the start.
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
        the program will work but the variables need to be named better.
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
        the 'int' object is not callable
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     you dont need float, you can add that later.
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     the top one is better because it is compact and faster to run.
     
 15. What is a constant?

        Something that always stays the same.
 
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?

        A constant is something that is static so the variable name would be different by default.
 
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.

     ' single quote, EX: 'ryan'
     " double quote, EX: "ryan"
     They do the same thing in python, there is no difference.
     
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?

        Yes, they do the same thing.
     
 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
     It will divide first because of order of operations.
     You'll need to add more brackets to make it work.

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?

        Symbols in python that carry out a problem.
        + or - to do addition or subtraction.
 
 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
     It prints x becasue x = 3, if you want to add 1 you do x = x + 1

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     
     value = int(input('Enter your age: '))
