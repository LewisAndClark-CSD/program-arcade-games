     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
        print("Grant")

  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
        you put a hash mark (#) in front of it

  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3) .666666666666666666667
     print(2 // 3) 0
     the first is division and the second is floor divison
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
        pi  = 3.141592654
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     The variable assigned is capital and the letter that wants to be printed is lower, it needs to be upper
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
     
    Area_Of_Rectangle
    
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     
     account# and total%
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     print(a) needs to be after a = 45
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
     pi should be an integer not a float
     
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     Pi could be more digits
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     in a being assigned, there should only be one set of paranthesis, a = (x * y)
     
     
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     it needs a * 3(x + y)
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     The float needs to be before input
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     it all prints the same thing except the first example is the best
     
 15. What is a constant?
 
 a variable that stays the same

 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
 
 
 other variable names might change but constants always stay the same
 

 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     
     ' ' this is a single set of quotations and these are doulbe quotes " ", both have the same function

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)
     
     " " /n

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
     
     yes, it can print with single strings

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
     there needs to be paranthesis around (3 + 4 + 5) so the computer knows to do that first

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
 
 it carries out the math function in python

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
     the program would print out 3

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
     

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     
     value = int(input("Enter your age: "))
     print(value)
