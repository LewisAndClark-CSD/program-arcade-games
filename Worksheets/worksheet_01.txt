     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
print('Jake Faucett')
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program? #
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     Answer:(2 / 3) = 0.66 (2 // 3)= 0 
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     The reason they are different is because floor division rounds it while regular division doesn't
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets it to an appropriate value.
pi = 3
  5. Why does this code not work?
     It wouldn't work because the first a is capitalized 
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use? area_of_rectangle
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     Answer: account number because you cannot have spaces
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     Answer: Because the print statement needs to be after the variable got set to a value.
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
       Answer: the 3.14 is unnecessary since it already is a float. 
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     Answer: you could get rid of the variable x entirely.
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     Answer: There is multiple statements found while compiling a single statement.
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     Answer: There is multiple statements found while compiling a single statement.
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     Answer: They called for radius to be printed
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     Answer: Yes they print the same value. The second one is the best because you don't want too many spaces but you do want some so it is not so clustered.
 15. What is a constant?
A variable that stays the same.
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?

  Answer: A constant stays the same but a constant will be able to change.
 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
       'My name'
 +     "My name"
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

     Answer: print('""'/n)
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?

     Answer: Yes
 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
Answer: It does division first because of order of operations
 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?

 Answer:An operator is a character that represents an action,
 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
Answer: 3
 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     
     
 +     Answer:username =input('Enter you name: ')
 +            print(username)
 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     
Answer:int(input("Enter your age: "))
