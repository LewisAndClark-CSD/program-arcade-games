     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
        print('Evie Nelson')
  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
        #comment
  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3) outputs 0.66666666
     print(2 // 3) outputs 0
     They output different answers since they are different equations.
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
        pi= 3.14
  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     The varaible is a capital a, so the print should be print(A).
     
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     The last one, Area_Of_Rectangle, is the best to use since it is the most specific.
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     The variables #left, account number, account.number, great.big.variable, 2x, 1Apple, total%, and account# are not valid variable names in python.
     
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     The variable a needs to be before the print line.
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     There is no print function.
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     The varaible pi could be set to 3.14 instead of x.
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     The a = ((x) * (y)) could be changed to a = (x*y).
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     The a = 3(x + y) should be a = (3*(x+y)).
     
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     It should be radius = float(input("Enter the radius:")).
     
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     They all work but the first one is best to use since it is the easiest to read and understand.
     
 15. What is a constant?
        A variable that is set to one value and therefore is always that value.

 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?
        They never change.

 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     A single quote is ' and a double quote is " .

 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
     Yes.

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     The 3, 4, and 5 added together need to be in () so they will be added together before being didveded by 3.

 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?
        The symbols that allow math equations to be done in python. Such as <, >, +, -, *, **, and /.

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     It will print out 3.

 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     The correct code would be user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     The code needs to be:
     value = int(input("Enter your age"))
     print(value)
