     Chapter 05 Worksheet

     
     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     
  1. Explain how the computer coordinate system differs from the standard Cartesian
     coordinate system. There are two main differences. List both.
The computer has the y coordinates reversed compared to the cartesian. The cartestian focuses on the upper right quadrantt. The computer figures out what is off screen so the programmer doesn't need to worry about it.
  2. Before a Python Pygame program can use any functions
     like pygame.display.set_mode(), what two lines of code must occur first?
It must have import pygame then pygame.init() and then size = (100, 700)
  3. Explain how WHITE = (255, 255, 255) represents a color.
White represents the presence of all colors in equal amounts.
  4. When do we use variable names for colors in all upper-case, and when do we
     use variable names for colors in all lower-case? (This applies to all variables,
     not just colors.)
In upper case when the variable won't change regardless of change. 
And we use lower case when the variable CAN change such as sky_color.
  5. What does the pygame.display.set_mode() function do?
pygame displays what the user did.
  6. What does this for event in pygame.event.get() loop do?
It tells what the user did.
  7. What is pygame.time.Clock used for?
  It displays the current time on the screen.
  8. For this line of code: (3 pts)
     
     pygame.draw.line(screen, GREEN, [0, 0], [100, 100], 5)
     
     * What does screen do?
     * What does [0, 0] do?
     * What does [100, 100] do?
     * What does 5 do?
Screen: Draws a line from the 0, 0 to 100, 100.
[0, 0] tells where the line starts from.
[100, 100] tells where the line is going to end at.
5 tells how many pixels wide it'll be while using a loop.

  9. What is the best way to repeat something over and over in a drawing?
Have the y_offset to zero. Set y_offset to increase by ten each time.
 10. When drawing a rectangle, what happens if the specified line width is zero?
The line won't show up.
 11. Describe the ellipse drawn in the code below.
     * What is the x, y of the origin coordinate?
     * What does the origin coordinate specify? The center of the circle?
     * What is the length and the width of the ellipse?
x, y is (20, 20).
The origin coordinates specify the four numbers if the order of (x, y, width, height).
The length and width of the ellipse is the first two numbers in the order.     
     pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, BLACK, [20, 20, 250, 100], 2)
     
 12. When drawing an arc, what additional information is needed over drawing
     an ellipse?
When drawing an arc over an ellipse it needs radians to determine what the angle to draw is.
 13. Describe, in general, what are the three steps needed when printing text to
     the screen using graphics?
The program to create a variable to hold the info. Second an image of the text. Third program tells where the omage of the text should be placed.
 14. When drawing text, the first line of the three lines needed to draw text
     should actually be outside the main program loop. It should only run once at
     the start of the program. Why is this? You may need to ask.
So as to prevent the text from being repeated an infinite number of times.
 15. What are the coordinates of the polygon that the code below draws?
     
     pygame.draw.polygon(screen, BLACK, [[50,100],[0,200],[200,200],[100,50]], 5)
The coordinates are at 50, 100 0,200 200,200 100,50 and with a width of 5.     
 16. What does pygame.display.flip() do?
It updates the screen with what has been drawn so far.
 17. What does pygame.quit() do?
It says the user asked to quit.
 18. Look up on-line how the pygame.draw.circle works. Get it working
     and paste a working sample here. I only need the one line of code that draws the
     circle, but make sure it is working by trying it out in a full working program.
pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, [55,50,20,25], 5)
