     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     
  1. Explain how the computer coordinate system differs from the standard Cartesian
     coordinate system. There are two main differences. List both.

0,0 starts at the top left
the t in reversed 

  2. Before a Python Pygame program can use any functions
     like pygame.display.set_mode(), what two lines of code must occur first?

     import pygame and pygame.int()
     
  3. Explain how WHITE = (255, 255, 255) represents a color.
     
     it apperas as white
     
  4. When do we use variable names for colors in all upper-case, and when do we
     use variable names for colors in all lower-case? (This applies to all variables,
     not just colors.)
     
     when its a fixed variable 
     when it changes though out the code
     
  5. What does the pygame.display.set_mode() function do?

sets the mode of the display

6. What does this for event in pygame.event.get() loop do?

it loops to print the pictures

  7. What is pygame.time.Clock used for?

  how many frames it has

  8. For this line of code: (3 pts)
     
     pygame.draw.line(screen, GREEN, [0, 0], [100, 100], 5)
     
     * What does screen do? it apperas on the screen 
     * What does [0, 0] do? it's the x 
     * What does [100, 100] do? it's the y
     * What does 5 do? how far away the pixels are
     

  9. What is the best way to repeat something over and over in a drawing?

  a while loop

 10. When drawing a rectangle, what happens if the specified line width is zero?

 nothing will appear 
 
 11. Describe the ellipse drawn in the code below.
     * What is the x, y of the origin coordinate? 20,20
     * What does the origin coordinate specify? The center of the circle? The starting point,  -250
     * What is the length and the width of the ellipse? length is 200 width is 2
     
     
     pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, BLACK, [20, 20, 250, 100], 2)
     
 12. When drawing an arc, what additional information is needed over drawing
     an ellipse? 
     
     PI

 13. Describe, in general, what are the three steps needed when printing text to
     the screen using graphics?

     1. creates a variable that holds information
     2. creates an image of the text
     3. program tells where this image of text should appear 
     
 14. When drawing text, the first line of the three lines needed to draw text
     should actually be outside the main program loop. It should only run once at
     the start of the program. Why is this? You may need to ask.

     because it will just keep drawing the lines of the shape 
     
 15. What are the coordinates of the polygon that the code below draws?
     
     pygame.draw.polygon(screen, BLACK, [[50,100],[0,200],[200,200],[100,50]], 5)
     
     50,100
     
 16. What does pygame.display.flip() do?

 displays all the shapes you have so far
 
 17. What does pygame.quit() do?

 quits the picture
 
 18. Look up on-line how the pygame.draw.circle works. Get it working
     and paste a working sample here. I only need the one line of code that draws the
     circle, but make sure it is working by trying it out in a full working program.
     
     it draws a circle around a point

     py.game.draw.circle(DISPLAYSURF, BLUE, (300, 50), 20, 0
