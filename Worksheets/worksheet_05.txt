     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     
  1. Explain how the computer coordinate system differs from the standard Cartesian
     coordinate system. There are two main differences. List both.

  The y coordiantes are reversed.
  the computer system covers the lower right quadrant while the cartesian system usually focuses on the upper right quadrant
  
  2. Before a Python Pygame program can use any functions
     like pygame.display.set_mode(), what two lines of code must occur first?

    import pygame
    pygame.init()
  
  3. Explain how WHITE = (255, 255, 255) represents a color.
  
    It uses red green and blue

  4. When do we use variable names for colors in all upper-case, and when do we
     use variable names for colors in all lower-case? (This applies to all variables,
     not just colors.)

     We signify variables that are constants by naming them with all upper-case letters. 
     if it is likely to change we use lower-case letters.
     
  5. What does the pygame.display.set_mode() function do?

  Opens a window
  
  6. What does this for event in pygame.event.get() loop do?

  It handles all the keystrokes, mouse clicks, and other types of events
  
  7. What is pygame.time.Clock used for?

  it is used to limit FPS
  
  8. For this line of code: (3 pts)
     
     pygame.draw.line(screen, GREEN, [0, 0], [100, 100], 5)
     
     * What does screen do?
     * What does [0, 0] do?
     * What does [100, 100] do?
     * What does 5 do?
     
    Draws on the screen
    Determines origin point
    Determines end point
    Determines how many pixels wide it will be
     
  9. What is the best way to repeat something over and over in a drawing?
  
  using a loop

 10. When drawing a rectangle, what happens if the specified line width is zero?
 
 It will cover 0 pixels

 11. Describe the ellipse drawn in the code below.
     * What is the x, y of the origin coordinate?
     * What does the origin coordinate specify? The center of the circle?
     * What is the length and the width of the ellipse?
     
     
     pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, BLACK, [20, 20, 250, 100], 2)
     
     It starts at coordinates 20, 20 and ends at coordinates 250, 100 and it is 2 pixels wide
     
 12. When drawing an arc, what additional information is needed over drawing
     an ellipse?
     
     It needs start and end angles

 13. Describe, in general, what are the three steps needed when printing text to
     the screen using graphics?
     
     First, the program creates a variable that holds information about the font to be used
     Second, the program creates an image of the text
     Third, The program tells where this image of the text should be stamped

 14. When drawing text, the first line of the three lines needed to draw text
     should actually be outside the main program loop. It should only run once at
     the start of the program. Why is this? You may need to ask.
     
     So that it doesn't keep repeating itself and popping up all over

 15. What are the coordinates of the polygon that the code below draws?
     
     pygame.draw.polygon(screen, BLACK, [[50,100],[0,200],[200,200],[100,50]], 5)
     
        It will be a rectangle
 
 16. What does pygame.display.flip() do?

 adds all of the changes you put into the code
 
 17. What does pygame.quit() do?
 
 exits the screen and stops the code

 18. Look up on-line how the pygame.draw.circle works. Get it working
     and paste a working sample here. I only need the one line of code that draws the
     circle, but make sure it is working by trying it out in a full working program.
