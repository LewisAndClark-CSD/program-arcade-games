     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     
  1. Explain how the computer coordinate system differs from the standard Cartesian
     coordinate system. There are two main differences. List both.

     1.(0,0) the origin starts at the top left instead of the middle. 
     2. The y coordinate is reversed as y goes up it goes down. 
     
     
  2. Before a Python Pygame program can use any functions
     like pygame.display.set_mode(), what two lines of code must occur first?

     import pygame and pygame.init()
     
     
     
     
     
     
  3. Explain how WHITE = (255, 255, 255) represents a color.
    
    It appears white for the backround usually
  
  
  
  4. When do we use variable names for colors in all upper-case, and when do we
     use variable names for colors in all lower-case? (This applies to all variables,
     not just colors.)
    
    Because it is a constant. When we want to change the value of the color we use lower case. 
     
     
     
     
     
  5. What does the pygame.display.set_mode() function do?
  
  It opens the screen.
    

  6. What does this for event in pygame.event.get() loop do?
  
  That is for if the user does something in the program like clicking. 
  


  7. What is pygame.time.Clock used for?
  
  Used to manage how fast the screen updates.
  

  8. For this line of code: (3 pts)
     
     pygame.draw.line(screen, GREEN, [0, 0], [100, 100], 5)
     
     * What does screen do? It make sure that it draws it on the screen. Initialize 
     * What does [0, 0] do? Makes the starting point 0,0
     * What does [100, 100] do? Thats the end point. 
     * What does 5 do? 5 pixels wide
     
     
     
     

  9. What is the best way to repeat something over and over in a drawing?

  Drawing it with a loop or offset
  Use this code to draw multiple lines 
  y_offset = 0
    while y_offset < 100:
        pygame.draw.line(screen,RED,[0,10+y_offset],[100,110+y_offset],5)
        y_offset = y_offset + 10
  
  
  
 10. When drawing a rectangle, what happens if the specified line width is zero?
    Nothing will appear 
 
 
 
 
 11. Describe the ellipse drawn in the code below.
     * What is the x, y of the origin coordinate? 20,20
     * What does the origin coordinate specify? The center of the circle? It is the upper left like a rectangle but with no corners. 
     * What is the length and the width of the ellipse? 250 pixels wide and 100 tall. 
     
     
     pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, BLACK, [20, 20, 250, 100], 2)
     
 12. When drawing an arc, what additional information is needed over drawing
     an ellipse?
     
     
     It includes the start and end angles for the arc to draw. 

 13. Describe, in general, what are the three steps needed when printing text to
     the screen using graphics?
     
     1.Create a variable that holds the information 
     
     2.  The program creates an image of the text.
     
     3. Tell the program where to put the image. Like a stamp. 
     
     
     

 14. When drawing text, the first line of the three lines needed to draw text
     should actually be outside the main program loop. It should only run once at
     the start of the program. Why is this? You may need to ask.
     
     Because if you keep it in the loop it will just keep drawing it over and over again. 
     
     
     
     
     

 15. What are the coordinates of the polygon that the code below draws?
     
     pygame.draw.polygon(screen, BLACK, [[50,100],[0,200],[200,200],[100,50]], 5)
     
     these are the 4 points [50,100],[0,200],[200,200],[100,50]
     
    
     
     
     
     
 16. What does pygame.display.flip() do?
    
    It updates the screen with what we have drawn so far. It must happen after all drawing commands have been executed or else you will not see them on the scree.     
    
    
 17. What does pygame.quit() do?
    When you exit the screen no error will pop up. 
 
 
 
 18. Look up on-line how the pygame.draw.circle works. Get it working
     and paste a working sample here. I only need the one line of code that draws the
     circle, but make sure it is working by trying it out in a full working program.
     
     pygame.draw.circle(screen, BLACK, (20,20), 20,0)
