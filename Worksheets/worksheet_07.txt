     NOTE: In the following problems, if an error prevents an example from running, make
     certain to mention that as part of the results. Also, be precise. If program prints [1],
     doesn't say it prints 1.

     
  1. List the four types of data we've covered, and give an example of each:
  The four types of data are int (3), bool (True), str ("string"), and float (2.76).

  2. What does this code print out? For this and the following problems, make
     sure you understand WHY it prints what it does. You don't have to explain it,
     but if you don't understand why, make sure to ask.
     Otherwise you are wasting your time doing these.
     
     my_list = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     print(my_list[1])
     print(my_list[4])
     print(my_list[5])
     This code will print out:
     2
     101
     error
     
  3. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list=[5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     for my_item in my_list:
         print(my_item)
     This code will print out:
     5
     2
     6
     8
     101
     
  4. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list1 = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     my_list2 = (5, 2, 6, 8, 101)
     my_list1[3] = 10
     print(my_list1)
     my_list2[2] = 10
     print(my_list2)
     The code will print:
     [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     error
     
  5. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [3 * 5]
     print(my_list)
     my_list = [3] * 5
     print(my_list)
     This code will print out:
     [15]
     [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
     
  6. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [5]
     for i in range(5):
     	my_list.append(i)
     print(my_list)
     This program will output:
     [5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
     
  7. What does this code print out?
     
     print(len("Hi"))
     print(len("Hi there."))
     print(len("Hi") + len("there."))
     print(len("2"))
     print(len(2))
     This code will output:
     2
     9
     8
     1
     error
     
  8. What does this code print out?
     
     print("Simpson" + "College")
     print("Simpson" + "College"[1])
     print( ("Simpson" + "College")[1] )
     SimpsonCollege
     Simpsono
     i
     
  9. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for letter in word:
         print(letter)
    This code will print out:
    S
    i
    m
    p
    s
    o
    n
     
 10. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for i in range(3):
         word += "College"
     print(word)
    This program will output:
    SimpsonCollegeCollegeCollege
     
 11. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Hi" * 3
     print(word)
    This code will print out:
    HiHiHi
     
 12. What does this code print out?
     
     my_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs."
     print("The 3rd spot is: " + my_text[3])
     print("The -1 spot is: " + my_text[-1])
    This code will print out:
    The 3rd spot is: 
    The -1 spot is: .
     
 13. What does this code print out?
     
     s = "0123456789"
     print(s[1])
     print(s[:3])
     print(s[3:])
     This code will print out:
     1
     012
     3456789
     
 14. Write a loop that will take in a list of five numbers from the user, adding
     each to an array. Then print the array. Try doing this without looking at the
     book.
     
userList = []
for number in range(5):
    number = int(input("Enter a number for a list: "))
    userList.append(number)
print(userList)

 15. Write a program that take an array like the following, and print the average.
     Use the len function, don't just use 15, because that won't work if
     the list size changes.
     (There is a sum function I haven't told you about. Don't use that.
     Sum the numbers individually as shown in the chapter.)
     
     my_list = [3,12,3,5,3,4,6,8,5,3,5,6,3,2,4]
     
my_list = [3, 12, 3, 5, 3, 4]
list_total= 0
for i in range(len(my_list)):
  list_total += my_list[i]
list_total = list_total/len(my_list)
print(list_total)
