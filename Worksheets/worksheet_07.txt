     NOTE: In the following problems, if an error prevents an example from running, make
     certain to mention that as part of the results. Also, be precise. If program prints [1],
     doesn't say it prints 1.

     
  1. List the four types of data we've covered, and give an example of each:
  
  string - list = ["This", "is", "a", "string"]
  Integer - list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
  Floating point - list = [5.234, 6.234, 9.534]
  Boolean - list = [True, False]

  2. What does this code print out? For this and the following problems, make
     sure you understand WHY it prints what it does. You don't have to explain it,
     but if you don't understand why, make sure to ask.
     Otherwise you are wasting your time doing these.
     
     my_list = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     print(my_list[1])
     print(my_list[4])
     print(my_list[5])
     
     It prints out 2, 101, then an error.
     
  3. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list=[5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     for my_item in my_list:
         print(my_item)
         
    It prints out 5, 2, 6, 8, and 101 on separate lines.
     
  4. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list1 = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     my_list2 = (5, 2, 6, 8, 101)
     my_list1[3] = 10
     print(my_list1)
     my_list2[2] = 10
     print(my_list2)
     
    It prints out an error.
     
  5. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [3 * 5]
     print(my_list)
     my_list = [3] * 5
     print(my_list)
     
     It prints out [15] then [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
     
  6. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [5]
     for i in range(5):
     	my_list.append(i)
     print(my_list)
     
     The code prints out 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in square brackets.
     
  7. What does this code print out?
     
     print(len("Hi"))
     print(len("Hi there."))
     print(len("Hi") + len("there."))
     print(len("2"))
     print(len(2))
     
     This code prints out 2, 9, 8, and 1 on separate lines, then an error.
     
  8. What does this code print out?
     
     print("Simpson" + "College")
     print("Simpson" + "College"[1])
     print( ("Simpson" + "College")[1] )
     
     It prints out SimpsonCollege, Simpsono, and i on separate lines.
     
  9. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for letter in word:
         print(letter)
         
     This prints out S, i, m, p, s, o , and n on separate lines. 
     
 10. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for i in range(3):
         word += "College"
     print(word)
     
     This code prints out SimpsonCollegeCollegeCollege.
     
 11. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Hi" * 3
     print(word)
     
     HiHiHi is printed out.
     
 12. What does this code print out?
     
     my_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs."
     print("The 3rd spot is: " + my_text[3])
     print("The -1 spot is: " + my_text[-1])
     
     It prints out "The 3rd spot is: " with a space at the end and "The -1 spot is: " with a . at the end.
     
 13. What does this code print out?
     
     s = "0123456789"
     print(s[1])
     print(s[:3])
     print(s[3:])
     
     The code prints out 1, 012, and 3456789.
     
 14. Write a loop that will take in a list of five numbers from the user, adding
     each to an array. Then print the array. Try doing this without looking at the
     book.
     
a_list = []
for num_in_list in range(5):
    user_number = input('Enter a number to add to the list: ')
    a_list.append(int(user_number))
    print(a_list)

 15. Write a program that take an array like the following, and print the average.
     Use the len function, don't just use 15, because that won't work if
     the list size changes.
     (There is a sum function I haven't told you about. Don't use that.
     Sum the numbers individually as shown in the chapter.)
     
     my_list = [3,12,3,5,3,4,6,8,5,3,5,6,3,2,4]
     
sum = 0
my_list = [3,12,3,5,3,4,6,8,5,3,5,6,3,2,4]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    sum = sum + my_list[i]
average = sum// len(my_list)
print(average)
