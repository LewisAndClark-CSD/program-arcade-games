     NOTE: In the following problems, if an error prevents an example from running, make
     certain to mention that as part of the results. Also, be precise. If program prints [1],
     doesn't say it prints 1.

     
  1. List the four types of data we've covered, and give an example of each:
  
  String - sequence of characters.
  Integer - whole number.
  Floating point - no fixed number before the decimal point. 
  Boolean - having two values. 

  2. What does this code print out? For this and the following problems, make
     sure you understand WHY it prints what it does. You don't have to explain it,
     but if you don't understand why, make sure to ask.
     Otherwise you are wasting your time doing these.
     
     my_list = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     print(my_list[1])
     print(my_list[4])
     print(my_list[5])
     
     *will print 2,101 but not the last one.
     
  3. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list=[5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     for my_item in my_list:
         print(my_item)
         
         *Will print all the numbers going down.
     
  4. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list1 = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     my_list2 = (5, 2, 6, 8, 101)
     my_list1[3] = 10
     print(my_list1)
     my_list2[2] = 10
     print(my_list2)
     
     *won't print anything you can't change the number its a tuple.
     
  5. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [3 * 5]
     print(my_list)
     my_list = [3] * 5
     print(my_list)
     
     *will print 15 then it will print 5 3's on a new line.
     
  6. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [5]
     for i in range(5):
     	my_list.append(i)
     print(my_list)
     
     *it will but 5 in the front instead of it not showing up.
     
  7. What does this code print out?
     
     print(len("Hi"))
     print(len("Hi there."))
     print(len("Hi") + len("there."))
     print(len("2"))
     print(len(2))
     
     *it will count the first 4 but the 5th one will not work.
     
  8. What does this code print out?
     
     print("Simpson" + "College")- prints the name without a space
     print("Simpson" + "College"[1])- prints just first work
     print( ("Simpson" + "College")[1] )- prints the letter i
     
  9. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for letter in word:
         print(letter)
         
    *prints the word downwards
     
 10. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for i in range(3):
         word += "College"
     print(word)
     
     *print's simpson then college three times
     
 11. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Hi" * 3
     print(word)
     
     *print's Hi three times
     
 12. What does this code print out?
     
     my_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs."
     print("The 3rd spot is: " + my_text[3])
     print("The -1 spot is: " + my_text[-1])
     
     *prints a space then a period
     
 13. What does this code print out?
     
     s = "0123456789"
     print(s[1])- prints the number 1
     print(s[:3])- prints 012
     print(s[3:])- prints 3-9
     
     
 14. Write a loop that will take in a list of five numbers from the user, adding
     each to an array. Then print the array. Try doing this without looking at the
     book.

     my_list(5,1,4,6,8)
     list_total = 0
     for i in range(len(my_list)):
        list_total += my_list[i]
     print(list_total)   
     
 15. Write a program that take an array like the following, and print the average.
     Use the len function, don't just use 15, because that won't work if
     the list size changes.
     (There is a sum function I haven't told you about. Don't use that.
     Sum the numbers individually as shown in the chapter.)
     
     my_list = [3,12,3,5,3,4,6,8,5,3,5,6,3,2,4]
     print(len(my_list))
