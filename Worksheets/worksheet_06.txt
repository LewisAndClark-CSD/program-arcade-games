     For each of the first two questions, write out your best guess as to what the
     code will print. Clearly label this as your guess. Then run the code and look at
     the output. Write if your guess was correct. If it was not, briefly describe what
     was different and why.

     Predicting what the code will do is important in writing programs, and
     figuring out why programs don't run the way expected.
     
  1. What does this program print out?
     (Remember: TWO answers. Your guess and the actual result. Label both.)
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
         
        it will print even numbers to 8
        it prints  
0
2
4
6
8
     
  2. What does this program print out?
     
     x = 1
     while x < 64:
         print(x)
         x = x * 2
         
         Itll print multiples of 64.
         
         It prints
1
2
4
8
16
32
         
         
     
  3. Why is the and x >= 0 not needed?
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10 and x >= 0:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     
    it isn't needed because it will always be true, never false.
    
  4. What does this program print out? (0 pts) Explain. (1 pt)
     
     x = 5
     while x >= 0:
         print(x)
         if x == "1":
             print("Blast off!")
         x = x - 1
     
     it does not print blast off because integers and strings are not equal.
     
  5. Fix the following code so it doesn't repeat forever, and keeps asking
     the user until he or she enters a number greater than zero: (2 pts)
     
     x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))
    
    
    while x <= 0:
      print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
      
        if x>= 0:
     print()
    
         
     
  6. Fix the following code:
     
     x = 10

     while x > 0:
         print(x)
         x - 1
         

     print("Blast-off")
     print()
  7. What is wrong with this code? It runs but it has unnecessary code.
     Find all the unneeded code. Also, answer why it is not needed. (1 pt)
     
     i = 0
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
         i += 1
         
         the i + 1 is unnecessary.
     
  8. Explain why the values printed for x are so different. (2 pts)
     
     # Sample 1
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
     for j in range(10):
         x += 1
     print(x)

     # Sample 2
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
         for j in range(10):
             x += 1
             
             
     print(x)
     
     Because the print statement has added indents which tells the program that it is seperate so it does not print the code, it just prints a space(as x would not be defined)
