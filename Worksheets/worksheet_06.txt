     For each of the first two questions, write out your best guess as to what the
     code will print. Clearly label this as your guess. Then run the code and look at
     the output. Write if your guess was correct. If it was not, briefly describe what
     was different and why.

     Predicting what the code will do is important in writing programs, and
     figuring out why programs don't run the way expected.
     
  1. What does this program print out?
     (Remember: TWO answers. Your guess and the actual result. Label both.)
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     
     guess: it will print till 8
     actual: 2 - 8
  
  2. What does this program print out?
     
     x = 1
     while x < 64:
         print(x)
         x = x * 2
     
     guess: it will print till 32 
     actual: it will print till 32 
  
  3. Why is the and x >= 0 not needed?
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10 and x >= 0:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     
     guess: it will never go under 0
     actual: it will never go under 0 
     
  4. What does this program print out? (0 pts) Explain. (1 pt)
     
     x = 5
     while x >= 0:
         print(x)
         if x == "1":
             print("Blast off!")
         x = x - 1
     
     guess: will count down till you get 0 but wont print blast off because its not assined. 
     actual: won't print blast off
     
  5. Fix the following code so it doesn't repeat forever, and keeps asking
     the user until he or she enters a number greater than zero: (2 pts)
     
     x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

     while x <= 0:
         print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
     
     guess: it will only print if x is less then or equal  to 0
     actual: will just keep looping and won't end 
     
  6. Fix the following code:
     
     x = 10

     while x < 0:
         print(x)
         x - 1

     print("Blast-off")
     
     guess: it will just keep looping 
     actual: didn't print the numbers and just printed blast off!
     
  7. What is wrong with this code? It runs but it has unnecessary code.
     Find all the unneeded code. Also, answer why it is not needed. (1 pt)
     
     i = 0
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
         i += 1
     
     guess: will print 0 to 10
     actual: it printed 0 to 9 because it always prints one less then the actual number given
     
  8. Explain why the values printed for x are so different. (2 pts)
     
     # Sample 1
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
     for j in range(10):
         x += 1
     print(x)

     # Sample 2
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
         for j in range(10):
             x += 1
     print(x)
     
     guess: will print numbers in a row without a space
     actual: the first one will print 20 and the second one will print 110
     the number just keeps looping 10 times and doubling the number
