     For each of the first two questions, write out your best guess as to what the
     code will print. Clearly label this as your guess. Then run the code and look at
     the output. Write if your guess was correct. If it was not, briefly describe what
     was different and why.

     Predicting what the code will do is important in writing programs, and
     figuring out why programs don't run the way expected.
     
  1. What does this program print out?
     (Remember: TWO answers. Your guess and the actual result. Label both.)
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
    My guess: 0,2,4,6,8 on seperate lines
    Output: 0,2,4,6,8 on seperate lines
     
  2. What does this program print out?
     
     x = 1
     while x < 64:
         print(x)
         x = x * 2
    My guess: 1,2,4,8,16,32 on seperate lines
    Output: 1,2,4,8,16,32 om seperate lines
     
  3. Why is the and x >= 0 not needed?
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10 and x >= 0:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
    You need to check for things that can never be false, ie x=0.
     
  4. What does this program print out? (0 pts) Explain. (1 pt)
     
     x = 5
     while x >= 0:
         print(x)
         if x == "1":
             print("Blast off!")
         x = x - 1
     This will print a countdown from 5 to 0, but will not print blastoff.
     The print("Blast off!") will not print because it is the wrong part of the code.
     
  5. Fix the following code so it doesn't repeat forever, and keeps asking
     the user until he or she enters a number greater than zero: (2 pts)
     
     x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

     while x <= 0:
         print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
         
     The program should look like:
x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

while x <= 0:
  x = float(input("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: "))
     
  6. Fix the following code:
     
     x = 10

     while x < 0:
         print(x)
         x - 1

     print("Blast-off")
     
     If the code is trying to print 1-10 backwards before printing Blast-off,
     the program should look like this:
x = 10

while x > 0:
  print(x)
  x -= 1

print("Blast-off")
     
  7. What is wrong with this code? It runs but it has unnecessary code.
     Find all the unneeded code. Also, answer why it is not needed. (1 pt)
     
     i = 0
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
         i += 1
     The i = 0 part of the code is unneeded since the range function will 
     always start at 0. The i += 1 is also unnecessary since the code will
     go by 1's until finished without it.
     
  8. Explain why the values printed for x are so different. (2 pts)
     
     # Sample 1
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
     for j in range(10):
         x += 1
     print(x)

     # Sample 2
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
         for j in range(10):
             x += 1
     print(x)
     
     For sample 1 the output is 20 since x is 10 plus 10, while for 
     sample 2 the code is in a loop so ten is added together 10 times, 
     and after looped 10 times the outside code adds 10.
