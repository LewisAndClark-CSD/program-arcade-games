     For each of the first two questions, write out your best guess as to what the
     code will print. Clearly label this as your guess. Then run the code and look at
     the output. Write if your guess was correct. If it was not, briefly describe what
     was different and why.

     Predicting what the code will do is important in writing programs, and
     figuring out why programs don't run the way expected.
     
  1. What does this program print out?
     (Remember: TWO answers. Your guess and the actual result. Label both.)
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
         
         
         0
         2
         4
         6
         8
         
     
  2. What does this program print out?
     
     x = 1
     while x < 64:
         print(x)
         x = x * 2
     1
     2
     4
     8
     16
     32
  3. Why is the and x >= 0 not needed?
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10 and x >= 0:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     
     Because 0 is already = to 0 and it is less than 10.
     
     There is no way x can go down in value in this loop.
     
     
  4. What does this program print out? (0 pts) Explain. (1 pt)
     
     x = 5
     while x >= 0:
         print(x)
         if x == "1":
             print("Blast off!")
         x = x - 1
         
         5
         4
         3
         2
         1
         0
         
         Does not print out blast off because x is == to the character 1.
     
     
     
     
     
     
  5. Fix the following code so it doesn't repeat forever, and keeps asking
     the user until he or she enters a number greater than zero: (2 pts)
     
     x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

     while x <= 0:
         print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
         
         
         
ANSWER:  x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))
         while x <= 0:
            x = int(input("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: "))
     You need to add an input and int on the statement in the while loop. Also set it to x
     
     
     
     
  6. Fix the following code:
     
     x = 10

     while x < 0:
         print(x)
         x - 1

     print("Blast-off")
     
     
     ANSWER:
     
     x = 10

     while x > 0:
        print(x)
        x = x - 1
        if x == 0:
            print("Blast-off")
     
     
     
  7. What is wrong with this code? It runs but it has unnecessary code.
     Find all the unneeded code. Also, answer why it is not needed. (1 pt)
     
     i = 0
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
         i += 1
         
         
         You don't need to set i to 0 because in range it will start at 0 automatically. Also you don't need the i += 1 because the for loop does that already. 
         
         
         
     
  8. Explain why the values printed for x are so different. (2 pts)
     
     # Sample 1
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
     for j in range(10):
         x += 1
     print(x)

     
     # Sample 2
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
         for j in range(10):
             x += 1
     print(x)
     
     
     Because the second one has a nester for loop so it will go through way more times than than the one above.
