     For each of the first two questions, write out your best guess as to what the
     code will print. Clearly label this as your guess. Then run the code and look at
     the output. Write if your guess was correct. If it was not, briefly describe what
     was different and why.

     Predicting what the code will do is important in writing programs, and
     figuring out why programs don't run the way expected.
     
  1. What does this program print out?
     (Remember: TWO answers. Your guess and the actual result. Label both.)
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     guess print 0 2 4 6 8 all on new lines
     actually prints 0 2 4 6 8 all on new lines
     
  2. What does this program print out?
     
     x = 1
     while x < 64:
         print(x)
         x = x * 2
    guess print 1 2 4 8 16 32 all on new lines
    actual print 1 2 4 8 16 32 all on new lines    
     
  3. Why is the and x >= 0 not needed?
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10 and x >= 0:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     x starts at 0 and never goes down so its always true
     
  4. What does this program print out? (0 pts) Explain. (1 pt)
     
     x = 5
     while x >= 0:
         print(x)
         if x == "1":
             print("Blast off!")
         x = x - 1
     guess 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0          no blast off because str 1 != int 1
     
  5. Fix the following code so it doesn't repeat forever, and keeps asking
     the user until he or she enters a number greater than zero: (2 pts)
     
     x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

     while x <= 0:
         print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
         x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))
  6. Fix the following code:
     
     x = 10

     while x > 0:
         print(x)
         x -= 1

     print("Blast-off")
     
  7. What is wrong with this code? It runs but it has unnecessary code.
     Find all the unneeded code. Also, answer why it is not needed. (1 pt)
     
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
         i += 1
     You do not need to set i to a number because it will be made in the for loop
  8. Explain why the values printed for x are so different. (2 pts)
     
     # Sample 1
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):            each of these loops are only being ran once for a total of 20 runs in all
         x += 1
     for j in range(10):
         x += 1
     print(x)

     # Sample 2
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
         for j in range(10):        this for loop is being done 10 times making it a total of 100 runs combined with the first it totals to 110 runs 
             x += 1
     print(x)
