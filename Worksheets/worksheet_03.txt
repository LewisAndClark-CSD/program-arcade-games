  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
 It should be written like this
temperature = int(input("Temperature: "))
if temperature > 90:
    print("It is hot outside.")
else:
    print("It is not hot out.")
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number > 0:
    print(number, "is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print(number, "is negative.")
else:
    print(number, "is zero.")
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number <= 10 and number >= -10:
    print('Success')
  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
It should look like this,

user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
if user_input.upper() == "A":
    print("Correct!")
else:
    print("Incorrect.")     
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
The code should be written like this,
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
number == 4
if number >= 0:
    print(number, "is positive.")
else:
    print(number, "is not positive.")
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
There is an invalid syntax. There is no ':'. There isn't an int on the first line of coding to acknowledge that it is a number.
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
There is an unexpected indent at the if statement, as well as at the else statement. 
The else staement has no ':'. 
The variables aren't the same.           
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
Regardless of what you type the program responds with, "That is good to hear!".     
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
Guess: I believe the code will print out that it is unable to load what the user wants it to respond to. 


Answer: The actual answer was  x= 5 y= False z= True Buzz. 

10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
Guess:      print x is equal to 5. print y is equal to 10. print y is less than z. print x is less than y. 
Answer: True
    False
    True
    False
    False
    True
    False
    False
    True
    False
    True
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
Guess: print 3 == 3 is true "3" == " 3" false true true 3 and 4 3 and 10 true true false 

Answer: There was an error at the very end of the code.  
True
False
True
True
True
False
False
True

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50
Things wrong with the program are the variables need a == before it as well as being in "". Also change else if to elif and the second else if to just else:.
