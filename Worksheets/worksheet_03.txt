  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     It's missing another parenthesis, so it should be float(input("Temperature: ")).
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.

     number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
     if number < 0:
          print(number, 'is negative.')
     elif number > 0:
          print(number, 'is positive.')
     else:
          print(number, 'is zero.')
          
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)

     number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
     if -10 < number < 10 + 1:
          print('Success')
          
  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
     
     The program printed "Correct!" when the user puts in a lowercase a.
     
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
     
      The first thing wrong is that it don't allow it to run 'x == 4', it has to be 
      'x = 4' because == doesn't define x as a variable. The second thing wrong 
      is that it don't allow the user to put in a number, so it won't print 'x is 
      not positive.'.
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     It needs a colon after 3. The second problem is that it needs another "=" next to the other one. The last problem is that print is indented more than it should be. 
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
     
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     The first problem is that its missing ":" after the word beaker. The second and third problem is the indentation for "print" and "else". The fourth problem is it didn't define "a"
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     The indentation on the print line is too many. Erase one or two spaces. 
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
     
  9. Look at the code below. Write your best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     Buzz
     yes.
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     Only the ones that are true 
     It prints if it's True and False
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     true or false
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
     

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     I personally changed "else if" to "elif" then I added "=" to the other "=" to form "=="
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50
