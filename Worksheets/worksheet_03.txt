  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
         
Temperature's input needs int
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.
     
     num= int(input('Enter a number: ')
if num=0:
    print(num)
elif num > 0 or num < 0:
    print(num)
else:
    print('That is not a valid number.')

  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)

  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
         
    should be if user_input.lower
     
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
     
     Should be x=4 and should be >=1 or >0
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
         
        if x=3 needs to have :
        if x==3 not x=3
        The print statement isn't working
     
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
         
         else needs : , 
         a needs to be answer still or set a to the value of answer
         it should be if a == beaker not a = beaker
         incorrect indentation will cause error to functions
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
     
     It says that is good to hear no matter what. You need an else statement
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
     
     the program will print the values of the variables and either fizz or buzz
     
     the program printed x=5, y=f, z=t, and buzz.
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
     
    it prints t,f,t,f,t,t,f,f,t,f,t

     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
     
the program prints an error.

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")True
False
True
False
False
True
False
False
True
False
True

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50

     the if_user_input should have more options, such as a, banker, A.
     Money was never defined
     Doesn't ask what you want, it's not very desciptive
