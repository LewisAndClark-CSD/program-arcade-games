  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     A second parenthesis at the end of the input statement
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.
     number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
          
          if number > 0:
              print("That number is positive")
          elif number < 0:
              print("That number is negative")
          elif number == 0:
              print("That number is 0")
 
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
           
           number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
           if number > -10 and number < 10:
               print("Success")
           else:
               print("Failure")
  
  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
     The choices do not print until the user inputs an answer
 
 5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     x is not defined and there does not need to be two equal signs in line one.
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     There needs to be 2 equal signs in front of the 3 and x is not defined.
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
     
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     There needs to be two = in front of a. The else needs to be alligned with the if. The else needs a : after it. a needs to        be answer.
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     The output will always be "That is good to hear!"
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
     
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     Guess: I think it will print "Buzz"
     Answer: It printed Buzz
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     Guess: I think there will be an error
     Answer: It printed
     True
     False
     True
     False
     False
     True
     False
     False
     True
     False
     True
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     Guess:It will print wether each one is true or false
     Answer: It printed true and false with an end error
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
     

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     The else if statements need to be elifs, the choices are not defined, and the statements need double equal signs.
     
     
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50
