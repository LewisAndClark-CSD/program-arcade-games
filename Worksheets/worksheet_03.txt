  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
         
         get rid of float and put int 
         
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.

     num = int(input("Enter a number: ")
     if num < 0:
      print ('Number is negative')
     elif num == 0:
      print('Number is zero')
     eles: 
      print('Number is negative')
     
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
     
     number = int(input('Enter a number'))
     
     if number <= -10 
      print ('success')
     if nuber >10
      print ('success')

     
     
  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
         
         should print answers first
     
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x == 4 -should be x = 4 
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
     user input statment
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")- should have int infront of input
     if x = 3- forgot : and double equal sign
         print("You entered 3")
     
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":-double equal-should be answer ==
         print("Correct!")
         else-forgot :
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
         
         says that is good to hear for any answer
     
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
         
         Fizz-guess
         Buzz-answer
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)

     False - correct 
     True - correct 
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50
         
         switch user_inpu to == not =
