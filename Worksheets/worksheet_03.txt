  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.

innum = input('Enter a number: ')
if innum > 0:
    print('Positive')
elif innum < 0
    print('Negative')
else:
    print('Zero')
    
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
     
innum = input('Enter a number: ')
if innum >= -10 and innum <= 10
    print('Success')
    
  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
it will always answer incorrect unless A is the input B has no specific 
response

  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x = 4
     if x > 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
less than or equal to is no longer a issue and x is now equal to 4 instead 
of compared to 4     

  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
no int() on the input, it does not compare x to 3 but uses a invalid sign,
nothing happens unless 3 is input

  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
answer is not the same as "a", the indentions are messed up, else is missing a 
colon, the if statment needs to be == so that it will compare them

  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
it will always print('that is good to hear!')   

  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
buzz
Output:
x= 5
y= False
z= True
Buzz

 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)                   true
     print(y < z)                   false
     print(x == 5)                  true
     print(not x == 5)              invalid
     print(x != 5)                  false
     print(not x != 5)              invalid
     print(x == "5")                invalid
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)  false
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)      true true
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)       true false
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)        true false
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")              true
     print(" 3" == "3")             false     
     print(3 < 4)                   true
     print(3 < 10)                  true
     print("3" < "4")               true
     print("3" < "10")              false
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )    false
     print( (2 == 2) == True )      true
     print(3 < "3")                 invalid
     

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50

     
it should be elif for ocupation b and c and there should be a else statment asking again if a invalid input is input.
