  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
     Its missing the second parentheses at the end.
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.
    userNum = int(input('Choose a number: '))
     if userNum > 0:
 	 print('Your Number is positve')
     elif userNum < 0:
 	 print('Your Number is negative')
     else:
 	print('Your Number is Zero')

  
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
    userNum = int(input('Choose a number: '))
    if -10 > userNum > 10:
 	print("'Success'")
    else:
 	print("'Failure'")
 
  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
     The Choices print after the user answers the question, with no prompt.
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
     
  There does not need to be two equal signs in front of x to set it to 4. The other is that the user doesnt choose a value for x.
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
     There needs to be two equal signs in the if statement, no colon after the if statement, and no int() in the x definition.
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
     In the if statment it does not call for 'answer', The else is not indented correctly, no colon after else, and there is no two equal signs in the if statment.     
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
     Or is not used correctly [Plus there is no space after the '?']
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
     My Guess: x= 5, y= 5, z= 5, Buzz
     Anwser: x= 5, y= False, z= True, Buzz     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
      My Guess: True, False, False, False, True, False, False, True, False, True
      Anwser: True, False, True, False, False, True, False, False, True, False, True     

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50

     Not using double equal signs, the user might put a lowercase letter, no space after user_input question, uses else if instead of elif and else
