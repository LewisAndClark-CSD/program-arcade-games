  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
         
         This is missing an int in front of the float
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.

     number = int(input("Enter your number: "))
                if number > 0:
                    print("Your number is positive.")
                elif number < 0:
                    print("Your number negative.")
                else:
                    print("Your number is 0!")
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)

     
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
if num > -10 or num < 10:
print('Success')

  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
     
     You have to set A and B to variables if you want to call on them later on other than just printing them as text
     
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
         
         The two things wrong with this code is that x should be set to an input so it can be changed other wise it could never be less than zero, and another problem is the indenting.
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
     
    x needs to be set to an int(input, the if needs to be indented, and the print statement needs to look like this: print("You entered " + x)
    
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
         
         Correct code:
         
answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
    if answer == "Beaker":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
     
     This code needs an else statement to provide an output if it isn't one of those two things.
     
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
         
         
         guess:             answer:
         x = 5              x = 5
         y = False          y = False
         z = True           z = True
         Buzz               Buzz
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
     
     
     Guess:     Answer:
     True       True
     False      False
     True       True
     False      False
     False      False
     True       True
     False      False
     True       False 
     False      True
     True       False
                True
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
     
     Guess:     Answer:
     True       True
     False      False
     True       True
     True       True
     False      True
     False      False
     True True  False
     True True  True
     False

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50

         The A, B, and C need to be in quotes like: if user_input == "A":
         This code could also use elif statements instead of else if
         There also needs to be a variable set to money and for whatever option gets selected that amount of money needs to be added money by:
    money = 0
         if user_input = "A":
            money = money + 100
         if user_input = "B":
            money = money + 70
         if user_input = "C":
            money = money + 50
