  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
         
         int instead of float
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.
     
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number > 0:
    print("This number is positive")
elif number < 0:
    print("This number is negative")
elif number == 0:
    print("This number is 0")

     
     
     
     
     

  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)

     
number = int(input('Enter a number: '))

if number > -10 and number < 10:
    print('Success')
else:
    print('Wrong')
     
     
     
     
  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
         
         It ask the question before giving the options to the question. 
     
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
         
    In the 1st line you only need 1 Equal sign(=). You should have an input statement instead of setting x to a certain number. 
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
         
        1. On the 1st line there is no "int" 
        2. On the 2nd line there needs to be a doube == and a : at the end(if x == 3:)
        3. The variable for the number is a bad variable(x) should be like "number"
     
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
         
        1. Line 2 needs double =
        2. else doesnt have a :
        3. else needs to be indented correctly (lined up with the if statement all the way to the left)
        4.Print is not indented correctly. 
         
         
        
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
         
       It says "That is good to hear!" no matter what. You need to add on the right side of line 2 next to "Glad" x == "Glad":. (Line should look like this. 
       if x == "Happy" or x == "Glad":_)
         
         
     
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
         
         Guess:Will print true and false statements. 
         
         Answer: It ran x = 5, y = true, and z = true also printed Buzz because z was true. If you set y to == 5 it would also print Fizz. 
         
         
         
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)

 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
     
     
     Guess: True
            False
            True
            True
            False
            False

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50
         
         Well there is multiple things wrong. 
         
         The else if needs to be a elif statement.
         The "= B: needs to have " " around the B same goes with A and C
         and you need to print the money amount so the user can see how much money.(Optional)
