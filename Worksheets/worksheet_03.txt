  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: "))
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
         
    This code was missing a parethese at the end of the input statment
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.
     
     user_Number = int(input("Please give me a number: "))
     if user_Number > 0:
        print("Your number is positive")
     elif user_Number < 0:
        print("Your number is negative")
     else:
        print("Your number is zero")
        
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
     
     user_Number = int(input("Please give me a number: "))
     if user_Number >= -10 and user_Number <= 10:
        print("Success")
     

  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     
     
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
         
    The input statment needs to be put after the print statments because the computer program will wait until input is given before continuing on to print the options
    and since the options are needed to answer the question it is important that they get printed before the question is asked
     
  5. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     
     x = 4
     if x > 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
         
    x needs to be assigned using a single equals sign, a double equals sign with check to see if it is equal
    
    zero is not a positive number so it should just be numbers above zero which return as positive
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
         print("You entered 3")
     
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
     answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or x == "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
         
         You need to add x == to the Glad also because the computer doesn't know to carry it over from the first one
     
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
         
    Guess:      Actual Result:
    x= 5        x= 5
    y= False    y= False
    z= True     z= True
    Buzz        Buzz
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
     
     Guess:     Actual Result:
     True       True
     False      False
     True       True
     False      False
     False      False
     True       True
     True       False
     True       False
     True       True
     False      False
     True       True
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
     
     Guess:     Actual Result:
     True       True
     False      False
     True       True
     True       True
     True       True
     True       False
     False      False
     True       True
     False      Unsupported type error

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
     
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input == "A":
         money = 100
     elif user_input == "B":
         money = 70
     elif user_input == "C":
         money = 50

     First the syntax isn't else if it's elif, also A, B, C are strings and thus need to be in quotes, finally user_input is being compared not assigned so it shouuld have double equals signs
