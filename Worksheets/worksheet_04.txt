     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     Don't create a loop that only loops once. That doesn't make sense.
     Python runs the code once by default anyway. Avoid loops like this:
     
     for i in range(1):
         # Do something.
     
     
  1. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print your name
     10 times, and then the word ``Done'' at the end.

name = 1
while name <= 10:
    name = name + 1
    print("Cole")
    
  2. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print ``Red''
     and then ``Gold'' 20 times. (Red Gold Red Gold Red Gold... all on separate lines.
     Don't use \n.)

RG = 1
while RG <= 20:
    RG = RG + 1
    print('Red ' + ' Gold')
    

     
  3. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print the even
     numbers from 2 to 100, inclusive.
     
    for num in range(2, 102, 2):
        print(num)
    

  4. Write a Python program that will use a while loop to count from
     10 down to, and including, 0. Then print the words ``Blast off!'' Remember, use
     a WHILE loop, don't use a FOR loop.

num = 11
while num >=1:
    num = num - 1
    print(num)
print("Blast Off!")
     
  5. There are three things wrong with this program. List each. (3 pts)
     
     print("This program takes three numbers and returns the sum.")
     total = 0

     for i in range(3):
         x = input("Enter a number: ")
         total = total + i
     print("The total is:", x)
     
    The print statement should be after the for loop
    The equation should be total = total + str(x)
     when you print it should be print("The total is:", total)
     
  6. Write a program that prints a random integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive).

import random
for x in range(1):
    print(random.randint(1,10))

  7. Write a program that prints a random floating point number somewhere between
     1 and 10 (inclusive). Do not make the mistake of generating a random number from
     0 to 10 instead of 1 to 10.

import random
for x in range(1):
    print(float(random.randint(1,10)))
    
  8. Write a Python program that will: (3 pts)
     
     * Ask the user for seven numbers
     * Print the total sum of the numbers
     * Print the count of the positive entries, the number entries equal to zero,
     and the number of negative entries. Use an if, elif, else chain, not just three
     if statements.
     
pos_num = 0
neg_num = 0
zero = 0
number_sum = 0
number_count = 0
while number_count <= 6:
    number_count = number_count + 1
    number_input = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    number_sum = number_sum + number_input
    if number_input > 0:
        pos_num = pos_num + 1
    elif number_input < 0:
        neg_num = neg_num + 1
    elif number_input == 0:
    zero = zero + 1
print("Your total is " + str(number_sum))
print('There were ' + str(pos_num) + ' positive numbers')
print('There were ' + str(neg_num) + ' negative numbers')
print('There were ' + str(zero) + ' numbers equal to zero')

  9. Coin flip tosser: (4 pts)
     
     * Create a program that will print a random 0 or 1.
     * Instead of 0 or 1, print heads or tails. Do this
     using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
     * Add a loop so that the program does this 50 times.
     * Create a running total for the number of heads flipped, and the number of tails.
     
heads = 0
tails = 0
count = 0
from random import randint
while count < 50:
    number = randint(0,1)
    if number == 1:
        print("Heads!")
        heads = heads + 1
    elif number == 0:
        print("Tails!")
        tails = tails + 1
    count = count + 1
print('You flipped heads ' + str(heads) + ' times')
print('You flipped tails ' + str(tails) + ' times')

        
    

 10. Write a program that plays rock, paper, scissors: (4 pts)
     
     * Create a program that randomly prints 0, 1, or 2.
     * Expand the program so it randomly prints rock, paper, or scissors
     using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
     * Add to the program so it first asks the user their choice.
     * (It will be easier if you have them enter 1, 2, or 3.)
     * Add conditional statement to figure out who wins.
