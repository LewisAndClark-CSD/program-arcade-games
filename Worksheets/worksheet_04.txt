     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     Don't create a loop that only loops once. That doesn't make sense.
     Python runs the code once by default anyway. Avoid loops like this:
     
     for i in range(1):
         # Do something.
     
     
  1. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print your name
     10 times, and then the word ``Done'' at the end.

     name = input("Enter your name: ")
     for i in range(10):
        print(name)
     print("Done")
     
  2. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print ``Red''
     and then ``Gold'' 20 times. (Red Gold Red Gold Red Gold... all on separate lines.
     Don't use \n.)

     for i in range(20):
     print("Red Gold")
     
  3. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print the even
     numbers from 2 to 100, inclusive.

     print(*range(2, 101, 2))
     
  4. Write a Python program that will use a while loop to count from
     10 down to, and including, 0. Then print the words ``Blast off!'' Remember, use
     a WHILE loop, don't use a FOR loop.

     n = 10
     while n >= 0:
        print(n)
        n = n - 1
    print("Blast off!")
     
  5. There are three things wrong with this program. List each. (3 pts)
     
     print("This program takes three numbers and returns the sum.")
     total = 0

     for i in range(3):
         x = input("Enter a number: ")
         total = total + i
     print("The total is:", x)
    
    1 = there needs to be a space after the : in print.
    2 = the input needs to be before the for loop.
    3 = needs to ask for 3 different inputs so you can do it with different numbers.
    
  6. Write a program that prints a random integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive).

    from random import randint
    print(randint(1, 10))
  
  7. Write a program that prints a random floating point number somewhere between
     1 and 10 (inclusive). Do not make the mistake of generating a random number from
     0 to 10 instead of 1 to 10.

     from random import randint
     print(float(randint(1, 10)))
     
  8. Write a Python program that will: (3 pts)
     
     * Ask the user for seven numbers
     * Print the total sum of the numbers
     * Print the count of the positive entries, the number entries equal to zero,
     and the number of negative entries. Use an if, elif, else chain, not just three
     if statements.
     
zero = 0
positive = 0
negative = 0

a = int(input("Enter your 1st number: "))
b = int(input("Enter your 2nd number: "))
c = int(input("Enter your 3rd number: "))
d = int(input("Enter your 4th number: "))
e = int(input("Enter your 5th number: "))
f = int(input("Enter your 6th number: "))
g = int(input("Enter your 7th number: "))
sum = ([a + b + c + d + e + f + g])
print(sum)
if a or b or c or d or e or f or g > 0:
    positive = positive + 1
elif a or b or c or d or e or f or g < 0:
    negative = negative + 1
else:
    zero = zero + 1
print("There was " + str(zero) + " zeros.")
print("There were " + str(positive) + " positive numbers.")
print("There were " + str(negative) + " negative numbers.")

     
     
  9. Coin flip tosser: (4 pts)
     
     * Create a program that will print a random 0 or 1.
     * Instead of 0 or 1, print heads or tails. Do this
     using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
     * Add a loop so that the program does this 50 times.
     * Create a running total for the number of heads flipped, and the number of tails.
     
heads = 0
tails = 0
count = 0

from random import randint
while count < 50:
    number = randint(0, 1)
    if number == 1:
        print("Heads!")
        heads = heads + 1
    if number == 0:
        print("Tails!")
        tails = tails + 1
    count = count + 1
print("Amount of Heads: " + str(heads))
print("Amount of Tails: " + str(tails))

     
 10. Write a program that plays rock, paper, scissors: (4 pts)
     
     * Create a program that randomly prints 0, 1, or 2.
     * Expand the program so it randomly prints rock, paper, or scissors
     using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
     * Add to the program so it first asks the user their choice.
     * (It will be easier if you have them enter 1, 2, or 3.)
     * Add conditional statement to figure out who wins.
     
import sys
choice = input("Rock Paper or Scissors? ")
from random import randint
number = randint(1, 3)
if number == 1:
    print("Rock!")
if number == 2:
    print("Paper!")
if number == 3:
    print("Scissors!")
if choice == "Scissors":
    choicenum = 3
if choice == "Paper":
    choicenum = 2
if choice == "Rock":
    choicenum = 1
if choicenum == number:
    print("You tied.")
    sys.exit(0)
if choicenum == 2 and number == 1:
    print("You won!")
elif choicenum == 1 and number == 3:
    print("You won!")
elif choicenum == 3 and number == 2:
    print("You won!")
else:
    print("You lost.")
