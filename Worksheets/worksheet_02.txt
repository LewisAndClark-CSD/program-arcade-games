a text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program.
  7. What is machine language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)
  a computer programming language consisting of binary or hexadecimal instructions that a computer can respond to directly.
  8. What is a first generation language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)
a machine-level programming language.
  9. What is a second generation language?
 a generational way to categorize assembly languages
 10. What is a third generation language? (Explain, don't just give one example.)
a generational way to categorize high-level computer programming languages.
 11. What is an interpreter and how does it differ from a compiler?
a program that can analyze and execute a program line by line.
 12. Search the web and find some of the most popular programming languages.
     List the website(s) you got the information from and what the languages are.

 14. What is the difference between the ``syntax'' and ``semantics'' of a
     language?
Syntax refers to formal rules governing the construction of valid statements in a language. Semantics refers to the set of rules which give the meaning of a statement.
 15. Pick a piece of technology, other than a computer you use regularly. Briefly
     describe the hardware and software that run on it.
My Nintendo 3DS and it runs on the netfront web browser
