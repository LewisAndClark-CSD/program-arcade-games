  1. Give an example of a binary number. (While a number such as ``1'' can be a
     binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number, try coming up with an example that
     better illustrates the differences between the different bases of numbers.)

     67 = 01000011
     
  2. Give an example of a decimal number.

    67 
    
  3. Give an example of a hexadecimal number.

    67 = 43
    
  4. Convert the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 from binary to decimal.

    1 = 1
    10 = 2
    100 = 4
    1000 = 8
    10000 = 16
  
  5. What is a compiler?

    A program that processes statements written in a particular code that a computer can read.
  
  6. What is source code?

    The original code.
  
  7. What is machine language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)

    A language like binary or hexidecimal that a computer can read and respond to.
  
  8. What is a first generation language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)

    A machine-level programming language.
  
  9. What is a second generation language?

    A gererational way to categorize assembly languages.
  
 10. What is a third generation language? (Explain, don't just give one example.)

    A generational way to categorize high-level computer programming languages like C++ or Java.
 
 11. What is an interpreter and how does it differ from a compiler?

    An interpreter translates programs one statement at a time while a compiler scans the entire program and translates it as a whole.
 
 12. Search the web and find some of the most popular programming languages.
     List the website(s) you got the information from and what the languages are.

 14. What is the difference between the ``syntax'' and ``semantics'' of a
     language?

     Syntax: formal rules governing the construction of valid statements in a language.
     Semantics: set of rules which ive the meaning of a statement.
     
 15. Pick a piece of technology, other than a computer you use regularly. Briefly
     describe the hardware and software that run on it.

    CPU: Quad-core 1.25 GHz Cortex-A53
    GPU: Mali-T720MP2
    RAM: 3GB
    - Has a fingerprint scanner.
    The phone is great and ive never had any problems with it, quality.
