82
  3. Give an example of a hexadecimal number.

Language like Python or C that has logical structures
 11. What is an interpreter and how does it differ from a compiler?
an interpreter translates a program one statement at a time, a compiler scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code. 
 12. Search the web and find some of the most popular programming languages.
     List the website(s) you got the information from and what the languages are.
