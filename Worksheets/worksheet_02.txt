  1. Give an example of a binary number. (While a number such as ``1'' can be a
     binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number, try coming up with an example that
     better illustrates the differences between the different bases of numbers.)

        50 = 0110010
        
  2. Give an example of a decimal number.

    50
    
  3. Give an example of a hexadecimal number.

        50 = 32
  
  4. Convert the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 from binary to decimal.
    
    1 = 1
    10 = 2
    100 = 4
    1000 = 8
    10000 = 16

  6. What is source code?
        
        Source code is the original code of a program
        
  7. What is machine language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)

  A language like binary or hexidecimal that the computer can read and function accordingly
  
  8. What is a first generation language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)
  
  A machine-level programming language

  9. What is a second generation language?

  The generational way to catagorize generational languages
  
 10. What is a third generation language? (Explain, don't just give one example.)
 
    A generational way to categorize high-level computer programming languages like C++ or Java.

 11. What is an interpreter and how does it differ from a compiler?

    An interpreter translates programs one line at a time while a compiler reads the program as a whole
