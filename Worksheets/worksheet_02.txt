  1. Give an example of a binary number. (While a number such as ``1'' can be a
     binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number, try coming up with an example that
     better illustrates the differences between the different bases of numbers.)

     1010
     
     
  2. Give an example of a decimal number.
  
    17

  3. Give an example of a hexadecimal number.

  A
  
  
  4. Convert the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 from binary to decimal.

  0, 2, 4, 8, 16
  
  
  5. What is a compiler?

  Turns source code into machine code
  
  6. What is source code?

  Code the programmer enters
  
  7. What is machine language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)

  Machine code is what the computer interpretes source code into
  
  8. What is a first generation language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)

  A combination of 0 and 1's to represent numbers
  It is the same thing as machine language
  
  
  9. What is a second generation language?

  Assembly language that uses a compiler to turn source code into machine code. 
  
 10. What is a third generation language? (Explain, don't just give one example.)
 
 A high level computer programming language. Like python or C. Turns source code directly into machine code. 

 11. What is an interpreter and how does it differ from a compiler?

 It runs source code and interprets it directly into machine code on the fly.
 
 It is diffirent because you can not switch between different computing machines like linux and windows.
 
 12. Search the web and find some of the most popular programming languages.
     List the website(s) you got the information from and what the languages are.

 14. What is the difference between the ``syntax'' and ``semantics'' of a
     language?

     syntax deals with the structure/form of the code
     
     semantics deal with meaning assigned to that specific symbol, character, or word 
     
     
     
     
 15. Pick a piece of technology, other than a computer you use regularly. Briefly
     describe the hardware and software that run on it.

     My phone has ram and an operating system(ios). The software is like the apps that I run on it.
