Lab 2: Computer History

	Paul Alan and Bill Gates ran a company called Microsoft. They together invented the personal computer. It all happened by accident because they wanted to impress their friends. They never thought it would have went far, they just wanted to mess around and create something new. This all started in Silicon Valley, created by middle class white kids in their garage. Technology is always getting more and more advanced. The original creators of Apple didn't have a time schedule. They coded when they wanted and they always worked well because they liked each other. At first people didn't really care about computers but there was always that one kid who fell in love with it and got into it.

	Back then the idea of putting text into a computer and having it make an outcome was mind boggling. The first computers were huge because they were filled with vacuum tubes which later got replaced with transistors but they were still too big to make a computer on your desk. Finally there was a final piece made called the CPU which made it work all together in a small form. The people who invented the microprocessor was Intel. They power 85% of the worlds computers. The Altair 8800 was the first personal computer. But people really couldn't get their hands on it.

	Ed Roberts wanted to create his own personal computer that you could buy. This was created far far away from silicon valley, IBM, or Intel out in the desert in Albuquerque New Mexico, in a building that was very runned down. Ed Roberts was running a calculator company named Mitts that was going very bad. Nobody was buying his calculators and he was going bankrupt. He needed 65k dollars just to stay afloat. When he created this machine, people were camping out and waiting for it over night. There was a huge demand for this computer and it saved his company.

	Apple started to have explosive growth. The company had more money than they could spend. The company was extremely young too, most workers being around 20 years old. The apple II set a new standard for personal computers. They needed a killer application, this application was called visical. Dan Brickland created the first electronic spreadsheet. It was able to calculate years ahead depending on your inputs and was way advanced for its time. This was planned to calculate things in your budget and make it easier on you.
