Woops?
	The “Triumph of the Nerds” is a documentary about the history behind computers and programming. The settings they had chosen for each ‘scene’ of the film intrigued me from the beginning.
	They began the film at a basketball game. I learned they were there due to the man, Paul Allen, who owned the building and basketball team. It turns out he had worked together with Bill Gates, who I had previously thought worked alone (or at least mainly with  the idea of Microsoft solely). Both of them were the creators of the Microsoft company, but Bill Gates is obviously more well known as its’ CEO. Microsoft’s original creation was based to make software for the Altair 8800, which I found interesting as they started off at something so simple yet now Microsoft is one of the biggest computer companies around the world.
	Shortly into the documentary, they had a section where they were showing off this young boy who had been into computers and technology ever since he was little. One of the things they had stated was that computing was a “boy thing”, as there were never girls around or interested in this type of thing. I believe this was and is very wrong, there most likely was women and girls interested but were unable to be a part of it due to certain/different circumstances. Grace Hopper helped prove this “boy thing” wrong. She had created the first computer language, called Coball, which I thought was a strange name and wonder how she came up with it. Computers and programming has and will continue getting better with the help of women. Society has improved immensely on the treatment and inclusion of women in environments and careers that are typically male-dominated.
	“Triumph of the Nerds” also spoke about how the Altair 8800 came to be. It was created when Robert’s company, MITS, was going under in debt. The Altair 8800 was hyped up and seen as this amazing invention before it even started selling. The film’s narrator showed the 2nd made Altair 8800. This was because when the 1st Altair 8800 was sent to have its’ photo taken for a magazine, it got lost in the mail. I thought that was really interesting and quite funny because this huge invention is ready to be announced and sell to people, and it just gets lost. I was curious to see if the 1st Altair 8800 was ever found, but unfortunately it had been shipped when Railway Express had went on strike and eventually bankrupt, losing the computer forever. Afterwards, though, MITS began selling the Altair 8800 and it skyrocketed. Sales were over 200 everyday, and Robert’s could finally pay off his debts.
	Something that caught my eye was the coder’s process and their living environment. They all basically lived together in their programming offices, and lived off of bad hygiene, coca-cola, and cold pizza. There was no certain schedule of when they had to work and when their breaks were, they just simply had to work the 80 hours per week. Personally, I find it gross whenever they had said that they didn’t like anything that took away time from programming, such as showering or other hygienics, because while programming is big and amazing you still need to take care of your body and your health. Coca-cola and cold pizza diets certainly did not help, but I cannot talk because I also eat lots of fast food, and drink Dr. Pepper daily. The programmers, though, would constantly share their finds or problems throughout the process of making them. This helped make it possible to have the huge sharing we have between programmers and coders today, like how we also pair up for projects.
	Lastly, the main thing that I really enjoyed was the fact this all started with an accident that was made attempting to impress friends. Life is unexpected, and we do things that we didn’t expect or want to do, but sometimes this can lead to amazing things. Gates and Allen are both billionaires due this “accident.” Just because something doesn’t necessarily go your way at the start doesn’t mean it won’t work out in the end. People will always find a way to fix problems, and better today’s technology and society. Accidents aren’t always accidents.
