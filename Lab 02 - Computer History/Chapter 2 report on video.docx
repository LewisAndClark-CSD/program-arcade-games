#Triumph of the nerds pt. 1

    Gossipers fueled the tech revolution, trying to find flaws with tech. Thought to be a hobbie for boy's, sparking curiosity at a younge age, near 6 or 7 years old. Not afraid to be called a nerd, takes thing at their own pace, whenever the feeling was just right. A bit part of a programmers diet seems to be cold pizza and Coca-Cola, I prefer Dr. Pepper and Plain Chips with Nacho Cheese. A real grab to attention for computer programmers is finding a solution to a problem, working with scientists and engineers. Program, during the first Generation was given through a paper feed that would record the information inputed to output the program. A hacker is differently defined, where in the present is seen as a bad person trying to get your credit card number and personal information, where in the past it was writing instructions for programs and working out problems. Programmers are like kids who never got out of their imagination and believe that what they can imagine can be created. Valves and transistors work the same but with size difference increadibly. Cubicles are more previlant in the past seen as open and free where today it would mean mundane and boring. Altar 8800, first personal computer to rival companies brought to light by a magazine, grabbing small minds to think larger than life. The glimmer in customers eyes for Alter 8800 to figure out the kit for computer maintenance that sparked ideas to make something better. A lot of bad hairstyles in the past, all flocking to a local club to discuss computers. Most of the solutions to a problem, like if the power went out or missing a key, they would just cry. BASIC was thought to not be basic enough to fit into the Alter 8800. Bill gates being one of the head of a monsterous empire of computers looks like  a mouse. Taking a 1000 to 1 chance Bill Gates took a chance to risk it all to build a buisness, proprably from his gambling problem. A big thing with programmers seems to be the amount of rock music that they would listen to at max volume. "The 60's happened in the early 70's..." the math from that quote doesnt seem very right, escpecially from a programmer. Steve Wazniac was a shy boy that had to couple with Jobs to get his genious out. Common problem with the first apple employee's was the fact that they didnt take company shares when Jobs gave the opprotunity instead of getting paid. Went from a 'scruffy 19-year old' to head of the greatest company as of today. Programmers and computer enthusiests took buisnesses by storm that was way from the norm.
